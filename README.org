#+title: reel

Rust-based HTTP implementation for Emacs.

* Examples
Reel's API is roughly based off of [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API][JavaScript's fetch API]].

By default, all Reel requests are async. You can wait for them by using
~reel-await~.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :eval never
(reel "https://example.com") ;; GETs "https://example.com" asynchronously

(reel-await
 (reel "https://example.com"))
#+end_src

The ~reel~ function allows you to specify a number of options.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :eval never

(reel "https://example.com"
      :method "POST"
      :headers '((Content-Type . "application/json"))
      )
#+end_src
