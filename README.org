*THIS IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS*

Rust-based HTTP implementation for Emacs.

Reel strives to be _non-interactive_ HTTP library for Emacs.

* Rationale
Emacs's built-in url.el library is insufficient for a lot of uses and arcane to
use, and other popular libraries either depend on url.el or external libraries.

My goal is to implement an HTTP library in Emacs and do it right.
* Goals
- Basic asynchronous HTTP requests
- REST clients
- REST server
* Examples
Reel's API is roughly based off of [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API][JavaScript's fetch API]].

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :eval never
;; GETs "https://example.com" asynchronously
(reel "https://example.com")
#+end_src

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :eval never
;; makes a POST request with headers
(reel "https://example.com"
      :method "POST"
      :headers '(("Content-Type" . "application/json"))
      :body (json-serialize '(:id 123)))
#+end_src
